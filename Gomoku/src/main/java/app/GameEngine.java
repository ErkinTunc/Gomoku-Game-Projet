/**
 * <p>
 * Core class that manages the gameplay mechanics of the Gomoku game.

 * <ul>
 *   <li>Managing the players, the grid, and game state</li>
 *   <li>Starting new games and resuming loaded games</li>
 *   <li>Executing rounds of gameplay, including move validation and win checking</li>
 *   <li>Expanding the grid dynamically if enabled</li>
 *   <li>Supporting save and load operations via serialization</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It also provides getters and setters to adjust game settings such as grid size,
 * win condition length, and initial piece counts.
